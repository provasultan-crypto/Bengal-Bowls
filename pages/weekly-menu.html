        <h2>How We Work</h2>
        <p><strong>Weekly Menu -</strong> Our menu changes weekly to offer variety and to work with what is available
            from local growers. All menu items are packaged and chilled, ready to reheat at your convenience. How it
            works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Our menu goes up Thursday morning on the "Weekly Menu" tab</li>
            <li>You can place an order until Monday morning at 11 AM. All orders must be pre-paid.</li>
            <li>Pick-up or Delivery option:
                <br><strong>Pickup: Tuesday:</strong> 3pm-6pm at Bengal Bowls in Potsdam
                <br><strong>Home Delivery: Wednesday:</strong> [for customers within a 15 mile radius of our Potsdam
                location]: You will see a "Home Delivery" option when you check out on our online store, with a
                <strong>$5 delivery fee for 0-5 miles and $7 for 5-15 miles.</strong> If selecting this option, your
                home address (or delivery address) must be entered on our website to ensure we can get your food to you.
                Deliveries will be made once a week on Wednesdays, between 12pm-5pm, and you will need to set out a
                cooler or cooler bag that is big enough to hold your order, which we will use to store your food.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Our freezer inventory is always available to order.</strong>
                <br>-If ordered at any time, you can always contact us to set up a pickup time for your frozen delights
                outside our pickup and delivery windows.
                <br><strong>*We recommend all of our frozen items to be defrosted overnight in the fridge before
                    reheating for best results.*</strong>
