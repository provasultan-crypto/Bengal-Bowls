                <p>From Bogra, Bangladesh to Potsdam, NY and with many stops in between, spreading Bangladeshi culture
                    and cuisine is an important way I stay connected to my roots,
                    and build community wherever I go. Over the past several decades I have built many friendships over
                    fresh, delicious, meals.</p>
                <p>In 2023 I was inspired by my husband’s health journey to intentionally focus on heart healthy cuisine
                    that looks good, tastes good, and feels good.</p>
                <p>From bright veggies to healing spices, every dish is made to nourish, comfort, and bring a little joy
                    to your table.</p>
                <p>No guilt, just delicious!</p>
